The following is a partially retrained version of the ResNet50 image identifier, retrained to identify different ingredient items in a picture of a dish
4 Different networks are used, since holsitcally the greatest success was found when the items the network was tasked to identify, worked best when
focusing on food items of the same category or similar look.

Average Accuracy across networks 63%
Image set in use YUMMLY28K from http://www.lherranz.org/datasets/
Data requires signifigant preprocessing to use, examples of data preprocessing are provided
